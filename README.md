# LLM Finance App

Welcome to the **LLM Finance App**! This project enables semantic search and interaction with financial documents using large language models (LLMs). By leveraging **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Transformers**, it helps analyze and interact with financial data through vector embeddings and semantic search techniques.

## Overview

The **LLM Finance App** provides an efficient way to analyze, search, and interact with financial documents like reports, articles, and news using state-of-the-art technologies:

- **Vector Embeddings:** Transform financial documents into vector representations, enabling semantic search.
- **Semantic Search with FAISS:** Quickly search documents based on meaning (rather than simple keyword matching) using FAISS for vector search.
- **LangChain Framework:** Manages interactions between the LLM, document loading, and querying.
- **Transformer-based Models:** Uses transformer models for deep understanding of financial terminology and context.
- **Interactive Query Interface:** Allows users to interact with the system by asking questions related to financial data.

## Features

- **Financial Document Analysis:** Efficient processing of financial documents such as PDFs, CSVs, or plain text files.
- **Semantic Search Engine:** Retrieve financial documents based on meaning using vector search, powered by FAISS.
- **LLM-based Interaction:** Ask questions about financial data, and get context-aware answers.
- **Customizable Workflow:** Users can load their own financial documents for analysis and querying.
